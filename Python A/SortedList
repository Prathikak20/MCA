#Write a python program that takes input from the user  for a list of student names and this corresponding scores.The program should then convert this data into a list of tuples,where each tuples contains  a students name and their score.The program should sort the list of tuples based on the scores in descending order and print the sorted list

n=int(input("Enter the number of students"))
students=[]
for i in range(n):
    name=input(f"Enter name of student{i+1}")
    score=float(input(f"Enter score of student{i+1}"))
    students.append((name,score))
sorted_students=sorted(students,key=lambda x:x[1],reverse=True)
print("\nSorted list of  students(name,score):")
for student in sorted_students:
    print(student)
