20. There is a file with several text messages.Each message is in its own line.Write a python program to count the no.of lines in the file and total no.of words contained in those messages.Assume the messages contain only alphabets and numbers.

def count_line(file_path):
    try:
        line_count=0
        word_count=0
        with open("file_path",'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                line=line.strip()
                if line:
                    line_count+=1 
                    words=line.split()
                    word_count+=len(words)
        print(f"Total no of lines:{line_count}")
        print(f"Total no.of words:{word_count}")
    except FileNotFounderror:
        print(f"Error:The file{file_path}does not exist")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occuredd:{e}")
file_path="abc.txt"
count_line(file_path)

Text fule name:abc.txt:-
hello world
good 
morning

OUTPUT:
Total number of lines: 3
Total number of words: 4
